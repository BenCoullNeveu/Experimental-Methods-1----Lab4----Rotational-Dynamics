# Experimental-Methods-1----Lab4----Rotational-Dynamics

This hopefully will simplify writing the jupyter files together, and where we can keep all files related to the notebook (csv files or other). 
To download the .pynb files, click on the project, then right click on 'RAW' > 'DOWNLOAD LINKED FILE AS...' to save it directly to your computer's drive. 
Although it isn't the most ideal method for collaborating remotely, I hope it will at least make it slightly less tedious to send each other files.
